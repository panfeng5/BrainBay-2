commands: 

display       to enter Display role
eeg           to enter EEG role
control       to enter Controller role

In order for a client to determine its current role, it can use the role          to print out the current role for this client

Another important command available to all roles is status        to print a table showing the client id numbers and roles for all

For example, if you do display
status

You will get from the nsd: 200 OK
200 OK
1 clients connected
0:Display

For EEG role devices, these are useful: setheader <EDFHeaderPacket>\n

For example, setheader 0                                                                                                                                                                       26.01.0418.36.01768     NEUROSD                                     -1      1       2   Elec 00         Elec 01         Active Electrode                                                                Active Electrode                                                                uV      uV      0       0       1023    1023    0       0       1023    1023    HP: DC; LP:  49 Hz                                                              HP: DC; LP:  49 Hz                                                              2048    2048    Reserved                        Reserved                        \n

Would use a 2048-Hz sampling rate dual-channel format, which ranges from 0 to 1023 in each channel.
Another option for EEG's alone is the data frame command, spelled '!': 

! <packetCounter> <channelCount> <sample[0]> <sample[1]> ... \n

For instance, ! 45 2 123 125

Means a sample frame with 2 channels and packet counter 45, with two data channels: 123 is sampled from one, and 125 from the other.
